# D.I.C.² 🛸
Detect → Identify → Control / Deploy → Intercept → Counter

*Unmanned. Unhinged. Unstoppable.* 

**D.I.C.²** is a modular, full-stack drone control and autonomy platform designed for custom-built quadcopters and DIY UAV systems.  
It combines embedded control, sensor integration, and mission-level intelligence into a flexible, high-performance kernel.


## 🌟 Why Use D.I.C.² ?

Because every great engineering project starts with:
> “How hard could it be?”

No DJI software. No safety nets. Just D.I.C.

## ✨🔥Key Features

- 🧠 **Mission-Adaptive Flight Logic**  
  Reconnaissance and tactical control modes: Detect → Identify → Control or Deploy → Intercept → Counter.

- 🛰️ **Autonomy-Ready Core**  
  Supports ...

- 🔧 **Hardware-Agnostic Kernel**  
  Interfaces cleanly with common sensors, ESCs, radios, and most off-the-shelf or DIY airframes.

- 📦 **Modular Subsystems**  
  Separation of concerns via discrete modules for flight control, comms, and mission execution.

- 🛡️ **Open-Source and Extensible**  
  Designed for educational, research, and *peaceful defense-oriented* use cases.
  
- 💀 Zero guarantees of safety. Run it at your own risk. Seriously.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
D.I.C.² is experimental, unstable, and potentially illegal in certain countries.
By using this code, you agree not to sue us when your drone:
- flies into resctricted airspace
- responsible for property damage or bodily harm.
- crash it; that’s called a **learning experience**.
- flies perfectly; that’s called a **miracle**.
Use at your own risk. And by risk, we mean *risk*.
